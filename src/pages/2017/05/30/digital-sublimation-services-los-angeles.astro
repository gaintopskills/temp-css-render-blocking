 <p>We specialize in digital sublimation printing services with unlimited potential!</p>

<h2>Our difference:</h2>

<p>We use a combination of two top tier machines: fastest in digital printing Mimaki and Italian Monti Antonio, the Rolls Royce of rotary heat press. Everything is done in house and we are able to provide you with the highest quality digital sublimation services. Not to mention quickly!</p>

<h2>Advantages of our digital sublimation printing:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Length:</b> Maximum width of fabric is 72”. The length can be as long as 100 yards. Rotary press allows non stop  printing of  curtains, bed spreads, table covers, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Ink Longevity:</b>  Unlike screen printing, ink turns into gas during the heat press and binds with fabric fibers. As a result, it stays sealed for life and doesn’t wash off.</li>
    <li><b>Quality of print:</b>  With top tier Monti Antonio heat press, color goes very deep into the fabric. When the fabric is stretched, color remains visible. This is perfect for any athletic and performance  apparel such as yoga wear, athleisure, jerseys, cycling wear, car racing apparel, sportswear, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Color vibrancy:</b>  You will notice a high degree of ink penetration and rich blacks as well as vibrant reds on your polyester fabrics.</li>
    <li><b>Perfectly matching cut panels:</b>  With engineered printing, we print cut panels that will allow perfect pattern matching and perfect label positioning when panels are sewn together.</li>
    <li><b>Unlimited potential:</b>  We print any pattern including photo realistic type digital printing. Items may include: backdrops, banners/ soft signage, flags, posters, T-Shirts, leggings, jerseys and other clothing, POP signs, pillow covers/ pillow cases</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Sublimation On Patches</h2>
    <p>You can also sublimate a custom patch that we can then embroider to any clothing.</p>
