<h2>Collection “Resurrection” Designed by Joe Perez and Screen Printed in the Heart of Los Angeles</h2>

<p>It was our pleasure to work with designer Joe Perez, who came out with his first collection entitled “Resurrection” Inspired by a derelict Masonic temple that stood unfinished for 75 years in downtown Providence. Abandoned since the 1920’s, it became a rite of passage for local skaters and graffiti artists to break in and leave their mark, making it a temporary sanctuary.</p>

<p>Joe Peres is a freelance creative director who gained prominence for helming Kanye West’s DONDA design studio from 2011-2016. He had his hands in multiple facets of Kanye West’s career, from artwork of covers and promotional items to working on the merch for Yeezus and Pusha T’s ‘King Push’ tour.</p>
