<h2>Our difference:</h2>

<p>We use a combination of two top-tier machines: the fastest in digital printing Mimaki and Italian Monti Antonio, the Rolls Royce of rotary heat press. Everything is done in-house and we can provide you with the highest quality digital sublimation services. Not to mention quickly!</p>
<h2>Advantages of our digital sublimation printing:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Length:</b> Maximum width of fabric is 72”. The length can be as long as 100 yards. The rotary press allows non-stop printing of curtains, bedspreads, table covers, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Ink Longevity.</b> Unlike screen printing, the ink turns into gas during the heat press and binds with fabric fibers. As a result, it stays sealed for life and doesn’t wash off.</li>
    <li><b>Quality of print.</b> With top-tier Monti Antonio heat-press, the color goes very deep into the fabric. When the fabric is stretched, the color remains visible. This is perfect for any athletic and performance apparel such as yoga wear, athleisure, jerseys, cycling wear, car racing apparel, sportswear, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Color vibrancy.</b> You will notice a high degree of ink penetration and rich blacks as well as vibrant reds on your polyester fabrics.</li>
    <li><b>Perfectly matching cut panels.</b> With engineered printing, we print cut panels that will allow perfect pattern matching and perfect label positioning when panels are sewn together.</li>
   <li><b>Unlimited potential.</b> We print any pattern including photo-realistic type digital printing. Items may include: backdrops, banners/ soft signage, flags, posters, T-Shirts, leggings, jerseys, and other clothing, POP signs, pillow covers/ pillowcases.</li></ul>
