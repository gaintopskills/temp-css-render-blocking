DTG vs. Screen Print?

Screen Printing is a process that involves pushing ink through a woven mesh stencil onto fabric. Only one color can be applied at a time. Therefore, each layer requires another screen. Screen printing is suitable for large-volume production. Unlike DTG printing, screen prints are more durable, will have crisper lines, and a much darker black.</p>

<p>Direct to Garment (DTG) is a method that uses inkjet printer technology, not unlike your officeprinter with ink cartridges. DTG printers are very precise and offer many colors, though the pallet is more limited than screen printing. Any image can be printed and customization is simple. Unlike screen printing, DTG printing requires much shorter set-up time.</p>

<h2>DTG or Screen Print?</h2>

<p>Of course, everything depends on the art, and generally speaking, one-color prints in large numbers should be screen printed, and one-offs with many colors should be printed DTG. Our team of in-house graphic designers will help you achieve quick turnaround time and will advise on which printing methods will yield the best result.</p>
